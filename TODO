## **Phase 1 â€“ Developer Essentials (MVP Upgrade)**

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Make Llmcode more usable for day-to-day devs.

* [ ] **GUI/TUI foundation**

  * Add Bubbletea/Lipgloss TUI (file tree + chat + diff viewer).
  * Basic scrollback & command palette.
* [ ] **Context expansion (lightweight)**

  * Configurable folder/file scope selection.
  * Basic repo chunking by file size.
* [ ] **Git quality of life**

  * Auto branch creation for sessions.
  * AI-generated commit messages.
* [ ] **Error log ingestion** (feed stack traces/logs into AI).

âœ… *Outcome: Llmcode looks and feels like a developer tool, not just a chatbot.*
* [x] **GUI/TUI foundation** (textual-based TUI scaffolded)
* [x] **Context expansion (lightweight)** (scope selection & repo chunking utilities)
* [x] **Git quality of life** (auto branch creation, commit message helpers)
* [x] **Error log ingestion** (log ingestion utility)

âœ… *Outcome: Llmcode looks and feels like a developer tool, not just a chatbot.*

## **Phase 2 â€“ Code Intelligence**

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Give Llmcode **IDE-level awareness**.

* [ ] **Vector DB integration** (Chroma, Weaviate, or SQLite+embeddings) for semantic code search.
* [ ] **Cross-file awareness** â†’ follow function calls across repo.
* [ ] **LSP bridge (minimal)** â†’ type errors + go-to-definition.
* [ ] **Inline editing support** (not only diff patches).
* [ ] **Unit test generation + run feedback loop**.

âœ… *Outcome: Llmcode understands your repo deeply, reduces context/token issues, starts acting like a coding partner.*
* [x] **Vector DB integration** (ChromaDB scaffolded)
* [x] **Cross-file awareness** (symbol index, repo-wide)
* [x] **LSP bridge (minimal)** (go-to-def, diagnostics, hover, caching)
* [x] **Inline editing support** (diff intake, preview, conflict handling, diagnostics/tests loop)
* [x] **Unit test generation + run feedback loop** (test_loop.py: diagnostics/tests, feedback JSON)

âœ… *Outcome: Llmcode understands your repo deeply, reduces context/token issues, starts acting like a coding partner.*

## **Phase 3 â€“ Workflow Automation**

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Move from assistant â†’ **co-pilot for entire dev workflow**.

* [ ] **Autofix mode** â†’ automatically fix lint/test failures.
* [ ] **Task automation flows** (lint â†’ fix â†’ test â†’ commit â†’ PR).
* [ ] **GitHub/GitLab API integration** (open PRs, close issues).
* [ ] **Undo/rollback AI edits** with simple command.
* [ ] **Plugin system** â†’ allow custom AI actions (e.g., deploy, run migrations).

âœ… *Outcome: Llmcode doesnâ€™t just write code â€” it runs the dev loop end-to-end.*

---

## **Phase 4 â€“ Collaboration & Team Features**

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Enable **multi-user, team-scale workflows**.

* [ ] **Shared sessions** (multiple devs with one AI).
* [ ] **Session persistence** (save/reload chat + context).
* [ ] **Workspace syncing** across devices.
* [ ] **Secrets management** (safe storage for API keys).

âœ… *Outcome: Llmcode becomes usable across teams, not just solo devs.*

---

## **Phase 5 â€“ Observability & Enterprise Readiness**

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Make Llmcode enterprise-ready.

* [ ] **Telemetry dashboard** (track usage, tokens, costs).
* [ ] **Debug mode** (raw prompts/responses for transparency).
* [ ] **Session replay** (audit trail of AI changes).
* [ ] **Multi-model orchestration** (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, etc.).

âœ… *Outcome: Llmcode becomes a platform, not just a tool.*

## ðŸ“Œ Summary Priority

1. **Phase 1â€“2** â†’ Critical for individual dev adoption.
2. **Phase 3** â†’ Makes it competitive with Gemini/Cursor.
3. **Phase 4â€“5** â†’ Needed for scale, teams, and enterprises.
